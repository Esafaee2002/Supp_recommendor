## Vitamin D Chatbot

Run `vitamin_d_chatbot.py` to launch an interactive command-line chatbot that
asks a few questions about your lifestyle and suggests whether you might
benefit from vitamin D supplementation.

```
python3 vitamin_d_chatbot.py
```

The chatbot uses a simple heuristic today but can be extended to leverage an AI
service such as MedGemma for more sophisticated guidance.
